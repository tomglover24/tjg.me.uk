Welcome to the New Website, this time built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site builder that combines markdown and templates into full html pages at build time.

This is my first blog post, in which I hope the be a little more active over the coming months.

This blog is fully open source, with the code that has built it found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomglover24/tjg.me.uk), feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/tomglover24/tjg.me.uk/issues/new) or pull request if you find a typo.
